\hl{GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT AND THE IDEA BEHIND IT.}
The detailed description of the development of the two proposed histological models, which are the heart of this work, will follow the present chapter and will occupy all the chapter \ref{sec:models}. Here I will dwell, instead, on every less common tool employed during the models' designing phase. From the practical point of view, this project is quite articulated and the development has required the harmonization of many different technologies, tools, and code libraries.
All the code necessary for the work has been written in a pure \texttt{Python} environment, using several already established libraries and writing by my self the missing code, for some specific applications. All the code produced during the development, the images, and the data produced have been collected in a devoted repository on GitHub \cite{repo}. I decided to code in \texttt{Python} given the thriving variety of available libraries geared toward scientific computation, image processing, data analysis, and last but not least for its ease of use (compared to other programming languages).
