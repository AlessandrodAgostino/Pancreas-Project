\hl{GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT AND THE IDEA BEHIND IT.}

In this chapter, I will try to resume in the more efficient way my work and the process I followed for the realization of this project. From the practical point of view, this project is quite articulated and the development has required the harmonization of many different technologies, tools, and code libraries. In section \ref{sec:tech_tool}, I will describe all the less popular technical tools I used in this project, and how I handled them during the modeling phase. In section \ref{ssec:panc_tis_mod}, I will describe all the necessary steps to create the model of a small region of pancreatic tissue, while in section \ref{ssec:derm_tis_mod} I will expose the steps I followed to build a model of dermal tissue. In section \ref{sec:synth_image}, instead, I will show the resulting synthetic images from the sectioning process performed on both the models and all the enrichments and processing necessary to give them the most realistic look I was able to recreate.
