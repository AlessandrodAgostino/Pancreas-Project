In this project, I face the problem of synthetic histological image generation for the purpose of training Neural Networks for the segmentation of real histological images. The manual analysis of histological specimen is a complex, time consuming, and expensive task even if it is a pillar of countless diagnostic techniques. Any form of support for this procedure hence is welcome and endorsed by the health-care system. In particular, in this work, I focus on the problem of specimen segmentation and its automatization. The most advanced algorithms for image segmentation are based on Deep Learning and requires the training of extensive and complex neural networks. One of the toughest hurdles to overcome for the training of those NN is the abundance and the quantity of pre-labeled examples of segmentation on real histological samples. The collection of hundreds of hand-labeled histological samples, with pixel-level precision, is virtually impossible. This work thus proposes a methodology to generate, in a completely automatic way, synthetic pre-labeled histological-like images, that can be used as training material for those NN.

The method I propose consists of the recreation of the traditional histological specimens' preparation, which is based on the sectioning of a 3D virtual model of a region of histological tissue. The virtual 3D model of a region of a particular type of human tissue is based on physical and physiological considerations. The model is then subject to a virtual sectioning operation, which yields the synthetic sampling of the virtual tissue in which the histological identity of every pixel is perfectly known. This first image will act as a segmentation mask for the second, realistic image. In fact, on top of this first image are applied several aesthetical processing and refinements and the final product is the synthetic histological-like image. The pair made of the two images is then perfect for the supervised learning of a NN oriented toward the segmentation of histological images. The production of each pair of images is completely automatic and it does not require the intervention of any human operator, it is thus a scalable process that can produce a great abundance of images. The quality of the images is directly connected to the richness and the quality of the model. The perfect modelization of a region of tissue, let's say human pancreatic tissue, is by far out of reach for this, hence the richness and the fidelity of the produced images are inevitably lower than the real sample. Nevertheless, the quality of the produced images is sufficient to perform the preliminary phase of the training of a NN following a training strategy known as curriculum learning. This learning process consists of giving the NN a copious quantity of lower complexity level example in the first instance, reserving the few and sophisticated real hand-labeled histological samples for the finalization of the training.

The first chapter of this thesis is devoted to the contextualization of the present work. It is offered a description of how the histological samples are obtained after a tissue biopsy and how the digitalization process of the images works. The reader is then introduced to the framework of Deep Learning, its fundamental aspect, and components. The concept of NN is exposed and it is given the general idea underneath the training of a DL-based model. The chapter comes to an end with a general introduction to the segmentation task in computer vision, and how it is currently tackled with state-of-the-art algorithms.

The second chapter collects all the details of every less common technical tool I used during the design of this project. A brief theoretical introduction is proposed for every item besides the thorough description of its practical use. Some of the arguments touched by this chapter are quaternions, quasi-random number generation, Voronoi decomposition, style transfer neural networks. In this chapter, a section is devoted to the description of a general methodology for computing the 2D section of an arbitrary three-dimensional polyhedron. The algorithm here described has been devised and implemented by my self, and then inserted in the workflow of the project. As a conclusion for this chapter, I describe the working environment I built for developing this project and the mention of all the code libraries I employed in my work.

The third chapter is the heart of this work, and it contains the description of all the design choices, and the steps I followed for the development of the two human tissue models I propose: the first of pancreatic tissue and the second of dermal tissue. The development has required the harmonization of many different technical aspects and mathematical tools. The first section is then dedicated to the description of the pancreatic tissue model, which passes through different steps: from a two-dimensional ramification taken as inspiration for the behavior of blood vessels to the complete three-dimensional model, with its subdivision in labeled cells. The second section is occupied by the description of the dermal tissue model, following the same spirit. The third section instead contains a thorough description of the method to perform the sectioning onto a virtual model and how to process the resulting images. It is necessary to perform several alternative processing and adjustment to achieve the desired aspect both for the segmentation mask image and for the histological-like image.

The method for the generation of datasets of synthetic images I propose in my thesis work is a self-supporting project and it is formally consistent. By the way, there are many possibilities for improvement and enrichment for the project. One first aspect to strengthen could be the richness of the models: adding more elements in the structure, and refining their representation ad the cellular level. This would lead to a better quality of the synthetic images, that would assist the training of NN in more and different applications. Another aspect that lends itself to improvements in the development of a dedicated style transfer NN targeting the histological texture transfer, which could lead to interesting signs of progress in the quality of image generation. There is also the intention to perform an actual attempt of NN training on the images produced with this process. This would complete conceptually the idea underneath the project and would be an excellent opportunity to detect weaknesses and to draw up possible lines of development. The repeated application of the generation method would allow the building of entire datasets suitable for the training of DL-based models.
