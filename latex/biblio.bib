abstract="The manipulation of rigid bodies by manipulators which are motor driven kinematic chains is a fundamental aspect of robotics. In this paper, we discuss the kinematics of such processes and discuss the classification of kinematic chains using ideas from algebra and group theory. Earlier work on the role of Lie groups in mechanisms is contained in Herv{\'e} [7], but the role of Lie algebras is not considered by this author. More relevant (but less group theoretic) is the extensive case-by-case analysis found in Pieper's thesis [9]. In fact, Pieper's work suggests an interesting and rather general problem in Galois theory which is directly related to manipulation. Also of interest is the well-known Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula for the derivative of a product of exponentials since such products are of fundamental importance in the study of kinematic programming.",

abstract = "This investigation evaluates various numerical algorithms; each designed to generate periodic 2-D Representative Volume Elements (RVEs) containing foam-like microstructures suitable for direct import into commercial finite element software for mechanical evaluation. The operation of each algorithm is discussed and the resulting RVEs are examined from both a mechanical and a morphological perspective. A basic Voronoi-based algorithm is found to be simple to implement but the method is shown to produce inherently anisotropic microstructures. Increasing the degree of irregularity of the microstructure reduces the anisotropy but at the cost of creating unrealistic microstructures, containing highly angular cells. A method of modifying such unrealistic microstructures using a centroidal tessellation relaxation algorithm is demonstrated, ultimately producing RVEs with relatively realistic mono-disperse microstructures. An alternative algorithm is also investigated the advantage of this algorithm is its ability to generate poly-disperse microstructures, with a controllable degree of poly-dispersity and an almost fully isotropic mechanical response."
